Bloorson Holdings

A simple app that allows users to register and login to post new listings they have available.

The app was built primarily in Ruby on Rails with HTML and CSS. The CSS was done using Bootstrap and SASS, using the scss notation. There is also a little bit of JavaScript with AJAX and jQuery.
